```

After cloning, just open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. To establish the SQL server connection with the database file (for eg: FileManager.mdf), specify the connection string in the web config file as follows.

```tsx

<add name="FileExplorerConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=true" />

```

Then, make an entry for the connection string in `appsettings.json` file as follows.

```tsx

"ConnectionStrings": {
    "FileManagerConnection": "Data Source=(LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\App_Data\\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30"
}

```

Now, to configure the database connection, set the connection name, table name and root folder ID value by passing these values to the SetSQLConnection method.

```tsx

void SetSQLConnection(string name, string tableName, string tableID)

```

> Refer to this [FileManager.mdf](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider/blob/master/App_Data/FileManager.mdf), to learn about the pre-defined file system SQL database for the EJ2 File Manager.

After configuring the connection, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the SQL database table.

```tsx

// Initializing File Manager with SQL Server Database service configuration.
<div>
    <div className="control-section">
        <FileManagerComponent  id="file"
            ajaxSettings = {{
                // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
                url="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLFileOperations",
                downloadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLDownload",

```tsx

git clone  https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem.git node-filesystem-provider

```

* After cloning, open the root folder and run the command **npm install** command.

After installing the packages, set the root folder directory of the physical file system in the package JSON under scripts sections as follows.

```tsx

"start": "node filesystem-server.js -d D:/Projects"

```

> **Note:** By default, the root directory will be configured to set `C:/Users` as the root directory.

To set the port in which the project to be hosted and the root directory of the file system. Run the following command.

```tsx

set PORT=3000 && node filesystem-server.js -d D:/Projects

```

* Now, open the Firebase service project from the Google services console, and generate a Secret key.

![generate_key](images/generate_key.png)

* After generating the secret key, replace secret key JSON in the access_key.json file in the Firebase Realtime Database provider project to enable authentication for performing read and write operations.

To interpolate with the Firebase Realtime Database, create a project under Firebase Realtime Database, and then enable the **read** and **write** permissions to access the Firebase Database by specifying the rules within the authentication tab of the Firebase project as demonstrated in the following code snippet.

> **Note:** By default, rules of a Firebase project will be **false**. To read and write the data, configure the  **Rules** as given in the following code snippet in the *Rules* tab in the Firebase Realtime Database project.

```tsx

{
  /* Visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security to learn more about security rules. */
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth!=null",
    ".write": "auth!=null"
  }
}

```

Then, create a root node and add children to the root node. Refer to the following code snippet for the structure of JSON.

```tsx

{
  "Files" : [ {
    "caseSensitive" : false,
    "dateCreated" : "8/22/2019 5:17:55 PM",
    "dateModified" : "8/22/2019 5:17:55 PM",
    "filterId" : "0/",
    "filterPath" : "/",
    "hasChild" : false,
    "id" : "5",
    "isFile" : false,
    "isRoot" : true,
    "name" : "Music",
    "parentId" : "0",
    "selected" : false,
    "showHiddenItems" : false,
    "size" : 0,
    "type" : "folder"
  },
   {
    "caseSensitive" : false,
    "dateCreated" : "8/22/2019 5:18:03 PM",
    "dateModified" : "8/22/2019 5:18:03 PM",
    "filterId" : "0/",
    "filterPath" : "/",
    "hasChild" : false,
    "id" : "6",
    "isFile" : false,
    "isRoot" : true,
    "name" : "videos",
    "parentId" : "0",
    "selected" : false,
    "showHiddenItems" : false,
    "size" : 0,
    "type" : ""
  }]
 }

```

Here, the `Files` denotes the `rootNode` and the subsequent object refers to the children of the root node. `rootNode` will be taken as the root folder of the file system loaded which will be loaded in File Manager component.

After that, clone the [`ej2-firebase-realtime-database-apscore-file-provider`](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-firebase-realtime-database-aspcore-file-provider) and just open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet package.

Register the Firebase Realtime Database by assigning the *Firebase Realtime Database REST API link*, *rootNode*, and *serviceAccountKeyPath* parameters in the `RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB` method of class `FirebaseRealtimeDBFileProvider` in controller part of the ASP.NET Core application.

```typescript

void RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB(string apiUrl, string rootNode, string serviceAccountKeyPath)

```

**Example:**

```typescript

void RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB("https://filemanager-c0f6d.firebaseio.com/", "Files", "{give the service account key path}");

```

In the above code,

* `https://filemanager-c0f6d.firebaseio.com/` denotes Firebase Realtime Database REST API link

* `Files` denotes newly created root node in Firebase Realtime  Database

* `{give the service account key path}` denotes service account key path which has authentication key for the Firebase Realtime Database data.

After configuring the Firebase Realtime Database service link, build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the File Manager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the Firebase Realtime Database.

```tsx

// File Manager sample with Firebase service.
<div>
    <div className="control-section">
        <FileManagerComponent  id="file"
            ajaxSettings = {{
                // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
                url="http://localhost:{port}/api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeFileOperations",
                downloadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeDownload",
                uploadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeUpload",
                getImageUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeGetImage"
            }} >
        </FileManagerComponent>
    </div>
</div>

```

## IBM Cloud Object Storage file provider

The IBM Cloud Object Storage file provider module allows you work with the IBM Cloud Object Storage. It also provides the methods for performing various file actions such as creating a new folder, renaming files, and deleting files. The IBM Cloud Object Storage file provider serves the file provider support for the File Manager component with the IBM Cloud Object Storage. We can make use of IBM Cloud Object Storage file provider by installing the [ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider)npm package or by cloning the [file provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider) from the GitHub.

### Using ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider npm package

* Install the ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider npm package by running the below command.

 ```tsx

npm install @syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider

```

* After installing the package, navigate to the ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider package folder within the node-modules.

* Run the  **npm install** command to install the dependent packages for file provider.

### Cloning the ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider from GitHub

* Clone the ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider using the following command.

```tsx

git clone  https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider.git

```

* After cloning, open the root folder and run the command **npm install** command.

To set the port in which the project to be hosted. Run the following command.

```tsx

set PORT=3000 && node index.js

```

> **Note:** By default, the service will run `8090` port.

Now, just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate file operation methods in the index.js file will allow to manage the IBM Cloud Object Storage.

```tsx
// File Manager sample with IBM COS service.
<div>
    <div className="control-section">
        <FileManagerComponent  id="file"
            ajaxSettings = {{
                url="http://localhost:{port}/",
                downloadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/Download",
                uploadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/Upload",
                getImageUrl="http://localhost:{port}/GetImage"
            }} >
        </FileManagerComponent>
    </div>
</div>

```
