# Add additional data on upload

The uploader component allows you to add additional data on file upload, which is used to get in the server-side. By using the [uploading](../../api/uploader/#uploading) event and its customFormData argument, you can achieve this behavior. Refer to the following example.

In the following code snippet, explains about how to add additional data on file upload.

```typescript
import { UploaderComponent, UploadingEventArgs } from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs';
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";

export default class App extends React.Component<{}, {}> {
  public uploadObj: UploaderComponent;
  public path: object = {
      removeUrl: 'https://ej2.syncfusion.com/services/api/uploadbox/Remove',
      saveUrl: 'https://ej2.syncfusion.com/services/api/uploadbox/Save'
  }
  private dropAreaRef: HTMLElement;
  public onCreated(): void {
      this.uploadObj.dropArea = this.dropAreaRef;
      this.uploadObj.dataBind();
  }
  public onFileUpload(args: UploadingEventArgs) {
    // add addition data as key-value pair.
    args.customFormData = [{'name': 'Syncfusion INC'}];
  }
    public render(): JSX.Element {
        return (
            <div className = 'control-pane' ref={dropAreaEle => this.dropAreaRef = dropAreaEle!}>
            <div className='control-section row uploadpreview'>
            <div className='col-lg-9'>
            <div className='upload_wrapper'>
                {/* Render Uploader */}
                <UploaderComponent id='fileUpload' type='file' ref = {upload => {this.uploadObj = upload !}}
                asyncSettings = {this.path}
                uploading={this.onFileUpload = this.onFileUpload.bind(this)} created={this.onCreated = this.onCreated.bind(this)} />
            </div>
            </div>
            </div>
  </div>);
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('fileupload'));
```

## Server side for adding additional data

```csharp
    // Get the additional data in server end by corresponding key.
    var data = HttpContext.Current.Request.Form["name"];
```
