# Find and Replace

Find and Replace helps you to search for target text and replace the founded text with alternative text within the sheet or workbook. You can use the [`allowFindAndReplace`](../api/spreadsheet/#allowFindAndReplace) property to enable or disable Find and Replace functionality.

> * The default value for `allowFindAndReplace` property is `true`.

## Find

Find is used to select the matched contents of a cell within sheet or workbook. It is extremely useful when working with large sets of data source.

**User Interface**:

Find can be done by any of the following ways:

* Select the Search icon in the Ribbon toolbar or using `Ctrl + F` key to open the Find dialog.
* Using find Next and find Previous buttons to search the given value in workbook.
* Select the option button in Find dialog to open the Find and Replace dialog then select the below          properties for enhanced searching.

> * `Search within`: To search the target in a sheet (default) or in an entire workbook.
> * `Search by`: It enhance the search, either By Rows (default), or By Columns.
> * `Match case`: To find the matched value with case sensitive.
> * `Match exact cell contents`: To find the exact matched cell value with entire match cases.

* Using [`find()`](../api/spreadsheet/#find) method to perform find operation.

## Replace

Replace is used to change the find contents of a cell within sheet or workbook. Replace All is used to change all the matched contents of a cell within sheet or workbook.

**User Interface**:

Replace can be done by any of the following ways:

* Using `Ctrl + H` key to open the Find and Replace dialog.
* Using Replace button to change the found value in sheet or workbook.
* Using ReplaceAll button to change all the found value's in sheet or workbook.
* Using [`replace()`](../api/spreadsheet/#replace) method to perform replace operation by passing the argument `args.replaceby` as `replace`.
* Using [`replace()`](../api/spreadsheet/#replace) method to perform replace all operation by passing the argument `args.replaceby` as `replaceall`.

## Go to

Go to is used to navigate to a specific cell address in the sheet or workbook.

**User Interface**:

* Using `Ctrl + G` key to open the Go To dialog.
* Using [`goTo()`](../api/spreadsheet/#goto) method to perform Go To operation.

In the following sample, searching can be done by following ways:

* Select the Home tab in the Ribbon toolbar, and then select the Search icon.
* Enter any value in the search textbox.
* Select the next (or) previous button to find the entered value in the spreadsheet.
